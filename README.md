# AirDC++ extensions

>This document defines the low-level AirDC++ extension specifications. If you are looking into developing an own extension, you might want to check out the [airdcpp-create-extension](https://github.com/airdcpp-web/airdcpp-create-extension) JavaScript starter project instead, which provides various abstractions for developers.

AirDC++ extensions use [AirDC++ Web API](http://docs.airdcpp.apiary.io) to communicate with the application via WebSocket or HTTP REST calls. Extensions are launched in a separate process with the specified [scripting engine](#scripting-engines) and their lifecycle and corresponding API sessions are managed by the application.


#### Scripting engines

Extensions are language-agnostic. However, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (JavaScript) is the preferred scripting engine as it will shipped with the future Windows application versions, and development utilities and most code examples are targeted for it.

Default scripting engines:

- *node* - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- *python3* - [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org)

There must always be a corresponding engine configured with the same name in the application in order for the extension to be launched. The list of scripting engines is currently hardcoded but will be customizable in future application versions. 


## Startup parameters

AirDC++ will supply generic API and path information for launched extensions via command line arguments.

Example extension startup command:

```python3 C:\AirDC\Settings\extensions\airdcpp-example-ext\package\extension.py --name=airdcpp-example-ext --apiUrl=[::1]:5600/api/v1/ --authToken=b1f872e9-ddf8-4d55-98e4-ae1a024908cd --logPath=C:\AirDC\Settings\extensions\airdcpp-example-ext\logs\ --settingsPath=C:\AirDC\Settings\extensions\airdcpp-example-ext\settings\ --debug```


| Name | Type | Example value | Description
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **name** | `string` | airdcpp-example-ext | Name of the extension |
| **apiUrl** | `string` | [::1]:5600/api/v1/ | HTTP (non-TLS) URL that the application should use when accessing the API. The implementation should add the wanted protocol prefix (`ws://` or `http://`) based on the communication method being used. |
| **authToken** | `string` | b1f872e9-ddf8-4d55-98e4-ae1a024908cd | Session token to use for authentication. WebSockets should use the [socket authorization method](http://docs.airdcpp.apiary.io/#reference/sessions/authentication/socket) while the [`Authorization` HTTP header](http://docs.airdcpp.apiary.io/#introduction/communicating-via-http/session-based-authentication) should be set with HTTP REST calls |
| **logPath** | `string` | C:\AirDC\Settings\extensions\airdcpp-example-ext\logs\ | Directory that can be used for saving extension-specific log files |
| **settingsPath** | `string` | C:\AirDC\Settings\extensions\airdcpp-example-ext\settings\ | Directory that can be used for saving extension-specific configuration files |
| **debug** | `boolean` | | If set, the extension may output additional information for debugging purposes |



## Extension content


### Managing the extension structure with npm (recommended)

The [`npm` CLI utility](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/npm) (usually shipped with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)) may be used even when developing non-JavaScript extensions.

#### Initializing the project

If you want to create an extension from scratch, you may use the `npm init` command in an empty directory that will prompt you about the generic fields. 

#### Creating installable package

Executing `npm pack` will pack the extension with correct directory structure without publishing it to npm. 


### Content structure for manual packaging

```
package
â”‚   package.json
```

All extension resources should be put inside a single directory (generally `package`) with `package.json` directly under it. For installation, the extension should be packed into a .tgz (.tar.gz) file.

Note that the name of the root package directory can be freely chosen. This enables direct installation of tagged releases from GitHub, assuming that the repository contains all files that are required for running the extension.



### package.json

Please see https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json for generic field descriptions.

Note that AirDC++ won't install possible external dependencies for extensions so all required resources should be shipped with the extension itself. 

#### Application-specific remarks

**Required fields**

`name`

Extension name. **The name must start with `airdcpp-`.**

`description`

Extension description

`version`

Extension version

`author`

Author's (user)name and possible email address

`main`

Script to execute by the application


**Optional fields**

`private`

If this field is set to `true`, the extension can't be accidentally published to `npm`. It also causes the application not to perform update checks for such extension from the npm registry. When writing extensions that you are not going publish on npm, it's important to enable this property so that your extension won't be replaced with another extension using the same name on npm due to updates offered to the user.

`keywords`

If you want the extension to be publicly listed in application's extension catalog, this field should contain the keyword `airdcpp-extensions-public`. If you don't want the extension to be listed publicly, you should omit this keyword.

`engines`

List of scripting engines to use for launching the extension. If the `engines` field is not set, the application will attempt to use the engine `node` by default.

Note that the application won't actually validate that the current engine version matches the wanted one. If needed, the extension should validate the engine version at runtime.

**airdcpp section (required)**

`apiVersion`

Target Web API version

`minApiFeatureLevel`

Minimum Web API feature level supported by the extension
